This algorithm is a simple technique that is easy to understand and implement. The steps done by this algorithm are an iterative solution of how a complex problem can be solved by repeatedly executing very simple steps. To understand how the insertion sort works, imagine that you have a couple of cards in one hand and you need to put them in order of their rank. One way to do it is to make sure cards on the left side in your have been sorted. Then pick up the third card (which is first not sorted) and place it on proper order among the first two cards. At any point in this process, we have two parts, the left part which is sorted and the right part which is not sorted.

The worst-case input is when the list is sorted in reverse order, this gives us a quadratic running time (i.e., O(n2)).

      "Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.Merge sort first divides the array into equal halves and then combines them in a sorted manner.\n",
      "How Merge Sort Works?To understand merge sort, we take an unsorted array as the following −We know that merge sort first divides the whole array iteratively into equal halves unless the atomic values are achieved. We see here that an array of 8 items is divided into two arrays of size 4.This does not change the sequence of appearance of items in the original. Now we divide these two arrays into halves.We further divide these arrays and we achieve atomic value which can no more be divided.Now, we combine them in exactly the same manner as they were broken down. Please note the color codes given to these lists.We first compare the element for each list and then combine them into another list in a sorted manner. We see that 14 and 33 are in sorted positions. We compare 27 and 10 and in the target list of 2 values we put 10 first, followed by 27. We change the order of 19 and 35 whereas 42 and 44 are placed sequentially.In the next iteration of the combining phase, we compare lists of two data values, and merge them into a list of found data values placing all in a sorted order.\n",
      "In Merge Sort, the given unsorted array with n elements, is divided into n subarrays, each having one element, because a single element is always sorted in itself. Then, it repeatedly merges these subarrays, to produce new sorted subarrays, and in the end, one complete sorted array is produced.The concept of Divide and Conquer involves three steps:1.\tDivide the problem into multiple small problems.2.\tConquer the subproblems by solving them. The idea is to break down the problem into atomic subproblems, where they are actually solved.3.\tCombine the solutions of the subproblems to find the solution of the actual problem.In merge sort, we break the given array midway, for example if the original array had 6 elements, then merge sort will break it down into two subarrays with 3 elements each.But breaking the orignal array into 2 smaller subarrays is not helping us in sorting the array.So we will break these subarrays into even smaller subarrays, until we have multiple subarrays with single element in them. Now, the idea here is that an array with a single element is already sorted, so once we break the original array into subarrays which has only a single element, we have successfully broken down our problem into base problems.And then we have to merge all these sorted subarrays, step by step to form one single sorted array\n",

We see here that an array of 8 items is divided into two arrays of size 4.This does not change the sequence of appearance of items in the original. Now we divide these two arrays into halves.We further divide these arrays and we achieve atomic value which can no more be divided.Now, we combine them in exactly the same manner as they were broken down. Please note the color codes given to these lists.We first compare the element for each list and then combine them into another list in a sorted manner. We see that 14 and 33 are in sorted positions. We compare 27 and 10 and in the target list of 2 values we put 10 first, followed by 27. We change the order of 19 and 35 whereas 42 and 44 are placed sequentially.In the next iteration of the combining phase, we compare lists of two data values, and merge them into a list of found data values placing all in a sorted order.')\n",
    "print('In Merge Sort, the given unsorted array with n elements, is divided into n subarrays, each having one element, because a single element is always sorted in itself. Then, it repeatedly merges these subarrays, to produce new sorted subarrays, and in the end, one complete sorted array is produced.The concept of Divide and Conquer involves three steps:1.\tDivide the problem into multiple small problems.2.\tConquer the subproblems by solving them. The idea is to break down the problem into atomic subproblems, where they are actually solved.3.\tCombine the solutions of the subproblems to find the solution of the actual problem.In merge sort, we break the given array midway, for example if the original array had 6 elements, then merge sort will break it down into two subarrays with 3 elements each.But breaking the orignal array into 2 smaller subarrays is not helping us in sorting the array.So we will break these subarrays into even smaller subarrays, until we have multiple subarrays with single element in them. Now, the idea here is that an array with a single element is already sorted, so once we break the original array into subarrays which has only a single element, we have successfully broken down our problem into base problems.And then we have to merge all these sorted subarrays, step by step to form one single sorted array')\n",

      "Recursion can be tough to understand — especially for new programmers. In its simplest form, a recursive function is one that calls itself. Let me try to explain with an example.Imagine you go to open your bedroom door and it’s locked. Your three-year-old son pops in from around the corner and lets you know he hid the only key in a box. (“Just like him,” you think.) Youre late for work and you really need to get in the room to get your shirt.You open the box only to find… more boxes. Boxes inside of boxes. And you don’t know which one has the key! You need to get that shirt soon, so you have to think of a good algorithm to find that key.There are two main approaches to create an algorithm for this problem: iterative and recuA recursive function always has to say when to stop repeating itself. There should always be two parts to a recursive function: the recursive case and the base case. The recursive case is when the function calls itself. The base case is when the function stops calling itself. This prevents infinite loops.rsive.Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself.All recursive algorithms must have the following:1.\tBase Case (i.e., when to stop2.\t3.\tWork toward Base Case4.\t5.\tRecursive Call (i.e., call ourselves)\n",
      "The \"work toward base case\" is where we make the problem simpler (e.g., divide list into two parts, each smaller than the original). The recursive call, is where we use the same algorithm to solve a simpler version of the problem. The base case is the solution to the \"simplest\" possible problem (For example, the base case in the problem  would be if the list had only one number... and by definition if there is only one number, it is the largest).Recursion is best used for problems where a large task can be broken down into a repetitive “sub-task”. Because a recursive routine calls itself to perform those sub-tasks, eventually the routine will come across a sub-task that it can handle without calling itself. This is known as a <bbase case – and it is needed to prevent the routine from calling itself over and over again without stopping. So, one can say that the base case stops the recursion.A call stack is a data structure used by the program to store information about the active subroutines (like functions in C++ or methods in Java) in a program. The main reason for having a call stack is so that the program can keep track of where a subroutine should return control to once it finishes executing. For example, suppose we have a method “CreateBox” which calls another method “CreateLine” in 4 different places. If the program has finished executing the method CreateLine, then it needs to know where in the CreateBox method it needs to return to. This is why the program uses a call stack – so that it can keep track of these details.A stack frame is a part of the call stack, and a new stack frame is created every time a subroutine is called. So, in our recursive Factorial method above, a new stack frame is created every time the method is called. The stack frame is used to store all of the variables for one invocation of a routine.

In other words, an event is a subset of the sample space to which we assign a probability. Although we have not yet discussed how to find the probability of an event, you might be able to guess that the probability of {2,4,6} is 50 percent which is the same as 12 in the probability theory convention. Outcome: A result of a random experiment. Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes. Event: A subset of the sample space.\n"
